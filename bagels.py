When I say:         That means:
    Pico            One digit is correct but in the wrong position.
    Fermi           One digit is correct and in the right position.
    Bagels          No digit is correct 
          
For example, if the secret number was 248 
and your guess was 843, the clues would be  Fermi Pico
